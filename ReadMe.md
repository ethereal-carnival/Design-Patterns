This project is a demonstration of a few well-known Design Patterns.

Presently, contains the implementation of a Duck provider using the following:
- Strategy Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Factory pattern

This codebase is loosely based on Christopher Okhravi's [YouTube video on Strategy Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I, "Christopher Okhravi: Strategy Pattern- Design Patterns (ep1)").
